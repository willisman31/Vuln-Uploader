# Vuln-Uploader

Automated tool for testing upload vulnerabilities; this tool currently has only basic enumeration functionality, the ultimate goal is to create script that can test for any non-complex upload vulnerabilities using only the target URL as input.  

## How to Contribute

This is a very young project and I plan to put a low but steady stream of effort into upgrading it over time.  If there is functionality you would like to be included please open a pull request, open an issue, or send me a message- no wrong answers here.
